Smart Online Order for Clover allows you to receive orders from your Wordpress website and have it sent directly to your Clover POS.

== Description ==

With **Smart Online Order for Clover** you can easily integrate and import your Clover inventory to show on your website in real-time. This will allow you to accept Online Orders from your website.

All you need is a Clover POS to easily display your menu on your website.

Allow customers to place orders from your website and then have the orders print to your Clover POS.

All orders can either automatically print or you can have the orders manually print. View all orders from your Clover POS. View daily/weekly/monthly reports from your Clover. This plugin is the ideal solution to get your business on-line in less than 10 minutes.

It’s also easy to do it yourself, if you get stuck, there are step by step instructions on You Tube – Search “Smart Online Order” on YouTube.

= How it works =

After installing the Smart Online Order for Clover plugin, add the pages "Order Online", "Checkout" and "My Orders" by going to Appearance then Menu from the Wordpress Dashboard. Then sync your website with your Clover POS using “Import inventory”.

There are also shortcodes that you can use. You would simply add the short-codes in a new post/page or an existing one.

If you already spent lots of time building out your Shop page using Woo-Commerce and would like to use your current Woo-Commerce inventory and then have those orders sent to the Clover – then, no worries we also have a solution for that. It is called **Woo-Commerce Payment Gateway for Clover**. You would still use the same app form the Clover App market “Smart Online Order” to receive your Woo-Commerce orders.

For Non-Wordpress websites, (we can create the online order page using Wordpress and then you would link it to your website.
The main difference of having a Wordpress website is that the Online Ordering can be up and running in less than 10 minutes. Give us a call or send us an email
if you don’t have a Wordpress website so we can create for you the Online Ordering page so you can link it to your website.

If you don’t have any kind of website and don’t know where to start give us a call or send us an email as we can make you a website with Online Ordering.
